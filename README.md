## About Dataset

Using Fashion-MNIST dataset. It is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. Zalando intends Fashion-MNIST to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the authentic MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the identical image measurement and shape of coaching and testing splits.

The original MNIST dataset contains a lot of handwritten digits. Members of the AI/ML/Data Science community love this dataset and use it as a benchmark to validate their algorithms. In fact, MNIST is frequently the first dataset researchers try. "If it doesn't work on MNIST, it may not work at all", they said. "Well, if it does work on MNIST, it may additionally nevertheless fail on others."

Each image is 28 pixels in peak and 28 pixels in width, for a complete of 784 pixels in total. Each pixel has a single pixel-value related with it, indicating the lightness or darkness of that pixel, with greater numbers which means darker. This pixel-value is an integer between 0 and 255. The training and test data sets have 785 columns. The first column consists of the class labels (see above), and represents the article of clothing. The rest of the columns contain the pixel-values of the associated image.
